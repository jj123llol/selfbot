Enter your discord auth code, then press enter.
If you need to know how to find it click [this link](https://www.androidauthority.com/get-discord-token-3149920/)

We use the auth to look into the channels you type in to see when you type a command, it also allows to send messages and edit them.


After that, it will ask for a prefix, enter what you want the command prefix to be, then press enter

Once it says "session connected" then you can enter any channel and type "(prefix)cmds" and it will edit the msg with the cmds list.



# Wl and UnWl info

Wl command allows others to use your commands, you can do {prefix}wl (@someone) to whitelist only them, or whitelist channels by just doing {prefix}wl

UnWl command removes the permission of someone to use your commands, you can do {prefix}unwl (@someone) to unwhitelist only them, or unwhitelist channels by just doing {prefix}unwl
